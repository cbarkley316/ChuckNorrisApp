Camden's struggles in making the "Chuck Norris" app:

- I had no trouble following a tutorial teaching me to make and disply a simple grided list with hard-coded data.
- I struggled to find out how to read the ICNDB JSON file and have THAT be my data.
    - Per the tutorial I was watching I was trying to read the contents of the "value" key as an NSSting.
    - But what took me a day to realize was that the content of the "value" key was another dictionary. (a dictionary within a dictionary). So I redefined my variable and was then able to access the "joke" key.
- I struggled the longest (3-4 days) on trying to get the cells to be big enough to fit the jokes.
    -I tried for a while to write code that would automatically adjust the height of the tableview cells but each tutorial said to set the contraints first. It took me a long time to learn that the settings for the cell's constraints were in Interface Builder.
    -Once I figured that out, for some reason it wasn't allowing me to set the constraints. So I found another tableview tutorial and started over.
    -I was then able to set the constraints of the cells but I couldn't figure out how to auto adjust the height.
    -So I did some trial and error with Interface Builder and set all 3 cells to be equally as large and display the entire text within each cell.

- Jame's email was vey helpful. Him telling me that I was creating a brand new view controller reminded me about something very fundamental that I had forgotten. When I am not working with classes, I am working with instances of classes.
    - I fixed this issue by using a solution in the BNR Objective C book. I created a "holder" property to hold the view controller instance. Then when the network manager obtained it's information I could pass it to that holder.
- I then ran into very few issues adding background color and autosizing cells.
